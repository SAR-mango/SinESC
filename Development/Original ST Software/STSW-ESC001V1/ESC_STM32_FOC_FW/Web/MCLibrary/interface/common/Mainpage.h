 *
 * This document aims to provide developper with a detailed description of
 *			- STM32 PMSM Motor control software library classes interfaces (module STM32_PMSM_MC_Library).\n
 *			Classes related parameters data structures (XXXParams_t) and class related methods descriptions are here reported 
 *			for each of the classes included in STM32 PMSM motor control software library
 *			- STM32 PMSM Motor Control API (module STM32_PMSM_MC_Application).\n
 *			It contains the descriptions of a set of commands that can be given from user level in order to execute motor control 
 *			actions
 *			- STM32 PMSM Motor control User Interface Library API (module STM32_PMSM_UI_Library).\n
 *			The user interface class library manages the interaction between the user and the motor control library by making use 
 *			of the motor control interface API.\n
 *			Classes related parameters data structures (XXXParams_t) and class related methods descriptions of user interface library 
 *			are here reported.
