/** @defgroup RCM Regular Conversion Manager
  * @brief Regular Conversion Manager component of the Motor Control SDK
  *
  * MotorControl SDK makes an extensive usage of ADCs. Some conversions are timing critical
  * like current reading, and some have less constraints. If an ADC offers both Injected and Regular,
  * channels, critical conversions will be systematically done on Injected channels, because they
  * interrupt any ongoing regular conversion so as to be executed without delay.
  * Others conversions, mainly Bus voltage, and Temperature sensing are performed with regular channels.
  * If users wants to perform ADC conversions with an ADC already used by MC SDK, they must use regular
  * conversions. It is forbidden to use Injected channel on an ADC that is already in use for current reading.
  * As usera and MC-SDK may share ADC regular scheduler, this component intents to manage all the
  * regular conversions.
  *
  * If users wants to execute their own conversion, they first have to register it through the
  * RCM_RegisterRegConv_WithCB() or RCM_RegisterRegConv() APIs. Multiple conversions can be registered,
  * but only one can be scheduled at a time .
  *
  * A requested user regular conversion will be executed by the medium frequency task after the
  * MC-SDK regular safety conversions: Bus voltage and Temperature.
  *
  * If a callback is registered, particular care must be taken with the code executed inside the CB.
  * The callback code is executed under Medium frequency task IRQ context (Systick).
  *
  * If the Users do not register a callback, they must poll the RCM state machine to know if
  * a conversion is ready to be read, scheduled, or free to be scheduled. This is performed through
  * the RCM_GetUserConvState() API.
  *
  * If the state is RCM_USERCONV_IDLE, a conversion is ready to be scheduled.
  * if a conversion is already scheduled, the returned value is RCM_USERCONV_REQUESTED.
  * if a conversion is ready to be read, the returned value is RCM_USERCONV_EOC.
  * In RCM_USERCONV_EOC state, a call to RCM_GetUserConv will consume the value, and set the state machine back
  * to RCM_USERCONV_IDLE state. It implies that a second call without new conversion performed,
  * will send back 0xffff which is an error value meaning that the data is not available.
  * If a conversion request is executed, but the previous conversion has not been completed, nor consumed,
  * the request is discarded and the RCM_RequestUserConv return false.
  *
  * If a callback is registered, the data read is sent back to the callback parameters, and therefor consumed.
