  * @par Demonstration description 
  * 
  *  This demonstration presents motor control application running on 
  * an STEVAL-ESC001V1 electronic speed control board with a BullRunning Motor. 
  *
  * The application features a PWM input for speed reference setting.

  * @par Hardware and Software environment 
  * 
  * This demonstration runs on the following Hardware Setup:
  * [STEVAL-ESC001V1] + [BullRunning BR2804-1700Kv-1] 
  *
  * The following software tools are needed to run the application:
  *
  * - ST Motor Control SDK, version 5.4.0 or later
  * - STM32CubeMx, version 5.2.0 or later
  * - STM32Cube FW Package for STM32F3 Series, version 1.10.0 or later
  * - IAR EWARM or Keil uVision 5.
  *
  * Note that the current version of this example does not work with STM32CubeIDE 1.0.0.
  *
  * @par How to build it ? 
  * 
  * In order to build the demonstration program, the following is to be done:
  *
  * 1. Open the ElectronicSpeedControl.stmcx file with the STM32 Motor Control Workbench PC software 
  *    tool and save it to another, empty, location.
  *    BEWARE: Do not change the name of the ElectronicSpeedControl.stmcx file, otherwise the example 
  *    will not work properly;
  * 2. Click the Tool -> Generation menu item. This opens a dialog window that lets the users choose
  *    various parameters. Select version 5.2.0 or later for STM32CubeMx, IAR EWARM or Keil MDK Arm 
  *    for the Target toolchain and STM32 FW V1.10.0 or later for the Firmware Package version. Make 
  *    sure to check the HAL - Hardware Abstraction Layer box for the Drive Type. Then, click on the
  *    UPDATE button.
  * 3. Open the generated project with the target IDE;
  * 4. Build the project and load the resulting binary image into your MCU board;
  * 5. Reset your MCU board;
  * 6. Run the example.
