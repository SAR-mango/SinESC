# SinESC
Bringing Sinusoidal Motor Control to the FPV community without giving up standard features or low cost. Ultra efficient and silent.
There are two versions of SinESC. Wing Edition and Multi Edition.
Wing Edition supports CAN and standard PWM control signals. CAN is intended for Pixhawk users, and standard PWM is intended to connect straight to an RC receiver.
Multi Edition supports SinWire, a custom 1-wire protocol that enables configuration, firmware updates, and speed control all through one wire.
SinWire support will be added to Betaflight soon. It aims to match or exceed DSHOT600's update rate.
